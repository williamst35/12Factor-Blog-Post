12 Factor blog
This 12 factor principles are interesting. what i like about them is they provide a routine for companies to check all aspects of their code before they launch, providing not just better code, but also more secure, and faster. I do believe that apps should be allowed to share code if authorized, i think not sharing code may just take up some time to rewrite it in certain circumstancess. Besides, other apps are allowed to use eachother through URLs so why not just allow the single app to access the code directly, that way say if one app crashes, the other can still function on its own. These 12 factors are a good structure for delevoping an app. 

I think this fits into the project because it provides an ideal of what companines around the world look at when desinging their own apps. Some of it confuses me still, and i dont quite understand all of it, but things like the logs, permissions, and run time are all important.
